# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I've code on my personal app of expenses, I worked on "AddExpense" screen and I made 3 cards with input for expense information.

**Thoughts:** I have to take a moment to think about project in the begining, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 1: January 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I've code on my personal app of expenses, I worked on "AddExpense" screen and I made 3 cards with input for expense information.

**Thoughts:** I would like to use flex gap available on react native 0.71, but expo latest sdk still using 0.70 version, this makes me curious about pros and cons of using expo.

### Day 2: January 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished my Crypto tracking app, that I made for training socket.io, I was planning make mobile and backend deploy but I realize that it would be difficult deploy a backend with socket.io for free, so I had to remove socket.io and pass the api calls to the front. I've learn how to make build without expo.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with KeyboardAvoidingView and BackgroundImage, I had to use Image instead of BackgroundImage and use KeyboardAvoidingView with different properties for android and ios. I think this kind of experiences is what makes us good software engineers.

### Day 3: January 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I spend some time refactoring my cryptotracker app and deploying it on playstore.

**Thoughts:** Even having worked around 2 years as mobile developer, thats my first deployment all by my self. I took a weight off my mind.

### Day 4: January 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I setup react native testing library and jest on my crypto tracking personal app. I spend a lot of time trying to making working and fixing errors, it's working now but now why yet.

**Thoughts:** There are no good documentation about react native testing library with typescript, I had to try some things, it works, but know I have to spend some time trying to undestand why. Maybe I make some PR for react native testing library with my project example.

##### Day 5: February 01, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I study react-native-testing-library and trying each match and undestand its use.

##### Day 6: February 02, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I learned and practiced three.js, a javascript library to render 3D elements. Tomorrow I'm going to use it to build a game at the Fubajam event, a game event at my university.

**Thoughts:** This library is really powerful and I'm exciting for explore where else I can use it
