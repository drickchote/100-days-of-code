# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I've code on my personal app of expenses, I worked on "AddExpense" screen and I made 3 cards with input for expense information.

**Thoughts:** I have to take a moment to think about project in the begining, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

**Thoughts:** I would like to use flex gap available on react native 0.71, but expo latest sdk still using 0.70 version, this makes me curious about pros and cons of using expo.

### Day 2: January 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished my Crypto tracking app, that I made for training socket.io, I was planning make mobile and backend deploy but I realize that it would be difficult deploy a backend with socket.io for free, so I had to remove socket.io and pass the api calls to the front. I've learn how to make build without expo.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with KeyboardAvoidingView and BackgroundImage, I had to use Image instead of BackgroundImage and use KeyboardAvoidingView with different properties for android and ios. I think this kind of experiences is what makes us good software engineers.
